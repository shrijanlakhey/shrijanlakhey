### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shrijan Lakhey, a Computer Science student at Kathford International College of Engineering and Management. I really enjoy debugging codes that give me hours or days of headaches. I'm currently learing Python, and trying to continue my journey in Django. CSS scares me literally but as I said I like things that give me a hard time, I'd like to learn one of the front end frameworks too.
